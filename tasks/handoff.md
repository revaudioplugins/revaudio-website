## 2026-09-06 (late) — /gas CTA iterations, committed locally, NOT pushed
- d6d10a3 original plugins.ts copy restored (Dan: "copywrite is not good"), new layout kept.
- f6a3612 red chunky CTA. 9e930b2 garage CSS pushbutton (brass bezel + screws + race-red body).
- d027c31 true-alpha CTA (house photo plate). Dan: "revert 2 times" -> gas.astro + DESIGN.md back
  to f6a3612 (red chunky CSS CTA). Garage + true-alpha variants stay in git history.
- (history) true-alpha CTA — `btn-mail-gmail.png` house photo plate reused (blank red pill),
  label = live text `.gas-cta-cap`, press-sink per tools/mailbtn-bench.html values. Gate contract
  (`data-trial-gate-open` etc.) untouched. OpenAI image credits EMPTY (credit_balance_exhausted) —
  no new AI assets generated. DESIGN.md §2 exception line updated. Do not push until Dan says push.

# Website handoff

Updated: 2026-09-06 (session close. Everything PUSHED and LIVE as `eadf56f`. Hero plate is live wearing PLACEHOLDER art - real Higgsfield plates still owed. Hero bench reverted and verified clean.)

## SESSION CLOSE 2026-09-06 (Claude Code) - read this first

State: branch `main`, PUSHED and LIVE at `eadf56f`. Do NOT trust any ahead-count written here -
two writers push this branch. Run `git fetch origin && git rev-list --count origin/main..HEAD`.
This file was committed after the push, so expect at least 1 ahead until someone pushes again.
All 12 local commits reached the remote at 2026-09-06 17:40 local. Claude Code did NOT run that push
and never had Dan word for it - his standing rule was "never push until i say to push clearly".
Commit identity is the shared `shlik` for both assistants, so git cannot say who ran it. Most likely
reading: Dan told Codex to push, the same way he steered its CTA reverts ("revert 2 times") in the
block above. Not treated as a rule break by anyone, just recorded. NOT undone either: reversing a
live deploy is Dan call alone.

CONSEQUENCE, the part that matters: the hero patina plate shipped to production wearing the
PROCEDURAL STAND-IN art, not Dan Higgsfield plates. revaudio.net now serves
`--plate-d:url(/_astro/hero-wall.CPIqxQSZ_1jT112.webp)`, a 43 KB PIL-generated gunmetal placeholder,
plus the 27 KB portrait one on phones. Pages deploy run `34039918954` succeeded, smoke test
`34039919110` passed. Dropping the real plates at the same two paths corrects it with no code
change. How it actually reads, verified not assumed (headless Edge shot of the live URL at
1280x800): the stand-in reads as a dark warm panelled wall with faint rivets and seams. Headline,
kicker, red sweep and gauge medallion are all legible and on-brand; nothing looks broken. What is
MISSING is every prop from prompt A - no trouble lamp, no headphones, no walnut shelf, no VU
meters, no dust beam. So this is a swap-when-ready, NOT an emergency revert.
Six are Claude Code (`4c65acc` `0be6bf5` `481560c` `8e675ca` `8c6932a` `c551052`), six are Codex
(`de69bad` `d6d10a3` `f6a3612` `9e930b2` `d027c31` `eadf56f`). `481560c` and `8e675ca` are the hero
tuning bench: still in history as commits, but their content is undone by `8c6932a`.

Working tree: clean (this file is committed). CODEX WAS STILL COMMITTING AND THEN PUSHED WHILE THIS WAS
BEING WRITTEN (`d027c31`, `eadf56f`, then the push), so re-check `git ls-remote origin refs/heads/main`
before trusting anything above. Codex tried a true-alpha photo-plate CTA on /gas in `d027c31` and reverted
it in `eadf56f`; `src/pages/gas.astro` is back to its `f6a3612` state, byte-identical. Codex owns
that file - do not stage, commit or revert it.

Background process left running: `astro preview` node pid 52112, 0.0.0.0:4321, serving `dist/`,
LAN `http://10.0.0.102:4321/`. Stop it BY PID only: `taskkill /PID 52112 /F`. Never broad-kill node.

Unverified at close:
- `dist/` predates Codex commits `9e930b2` / `d027c31` / `eadf56f`, so the built /gas is stale.
  The hero in `dist/` is current and was checked. Rebuild before judging /gas from `dist/`.
- Hero scrim contrast has NOT been re-measured against a real photo plate; the shipping numbers
  (1.18 / 120% / 43% / 61% = 5.16:1) were measured against the procedural stand-in.

Next session decides:
1. FIRST, because placeholder art is live right now: get the two Higgsfield plates onto disk.
   Portrait 9:16 -> `src/assets/hero/hero-wall-m.jpg`, desktop 16:9 -> `src/assets/hero/hero-wall.jpg`.
   Prompts in `tasks/hero-higgsfield-prompts.md`. Dan sent a 1600x2400 portrait in chat on 2026-09-06
   that never reached disk - ask him for the FILE, not the image.
2. Owed the moment real plates land, all still open: re-measure scrim contrast (4.5:1 on kicker and
   lede - the shipping 1.18 / 120% / 43% / 61% = 5.16:1 was measured against the stand-in), plate
   opacity against the smoke, plate under 250 KB at 1920, and the `DESIGN.md` ride-along (0/4/5/7/10).
3. The /gas CTA look. Codex has now tried three: the red chunky button (`f6a3612`), the garage
   anodized pushbutton (`9e930b2`), the true-alpha photo plate (`d027c31`), and landed back on the
   red chunky one (`eadf56f`). Dan has not picked. Codex owns the file.

No commit splits proposed by Claude Code: all of its work is committed and the tree is clean.

## 2026-09-06 (latest) - /gas sells more: DONE, committed locally, NOT pushed
Owner: Claude Code. Repo `revaudio-website`, branch `main` (local, ahead of `origin/main`).
Dan: "lets work on the gas page, lets make it sell more" + "work with psychologic and make it simple".
GAS is free, so "sell" = more email-gated downloads. One screen on desktop kept (Dan 2026-07-30).
- `src/pages/gas.astro`: hook "One knob. Sounds expensive."; three-line "what is the catch"
  list (full version / free forever / no trial clock / no credit card / Win + Mac + formats);
  CTA "Get GAS free" (still the TrialGateModal gate, never a plain link); fine print under the
  button says the email step BEFORE the modal opens; video badge labelled with its true length
  2:46, play dot brass so the CTA is the only warm block; named grid areas re-order for phones
  (CTA + fine print above the fold at 390x844, badge last). `<title>` "GAS: free one-knob
  saturator", description with formats. Copy pulls `plugin.oneLiner` from plugins.ts, unchanged.
- `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro`: `og:image` is now an absolute URL (site-wide, one line).
- `public/og/gas.png` (new, 1200x630) + `public/og-default.png` (new; the live site 404ed it).
- Checks: `npm run build` green (19 pages). Headless shots 1280x665 DPR2 + 390x844 with the cookie
  banner declined + modal + video lightbox: all OK, sent to Dan. Nothing invented: no counts,
  stars, quotes, timers.
- Plan + review: `tasks/todo.md`. Not done on purpose: no audio A/B rack, no RevLimiter cross-sell.
- Next: Dan reviews the shots and says "push". Until then: local only.

## 2026-09-06 (later) — hero patina pass "the bench at night": WIRED, stand-in plates, NOT pushed
Owner: Claude Code. Repo `revaudio-website`, branch `main` (local, ahead of `origin/main`).
Dan: "lets see it !" so the wiring is built now with procedural stand-in plates (PIL: gunmetal
panels, seams, rivets, oxide patches, amber lamp top-left, dark centre). They are placeholders only;
Dan's Higgsfield plates replace the two jpgs 1:1 (same paths, same names), no code change needed.
- Built: `src/pages/index.astro` hero: `getImage()` both plates to webp, `--plate-d` / `--plate-m` on
  `.hero-feat`; `.hero-plate` > `.hero-plate-img[data-drift-y=16]` first child; CSS: `isolation:
  isolate` on `.hero-feat`, plate z:-2 full-bleed, `--plate-alpha` .88 (.8 on phones), `::after` =
  lamp spill + 30% `--bg-0` scrim + bottom fade; `html.hc` hides it; ≤860px swaps to the 9:16 plate.
- Checked: `npm run build` green; headless Edge 1280x800 + 390x844 shots: plate full-bleed behind
  gauge, headline contrast holds, phone swap works. Not yet re-measured: scrim knobs vs a REAL plate.
- Dan sent a 1600x2400 portrait image in chat (not on disk anywhere). Asked him to save it as
  `src/assets/hero/hero-wall-m.jpg`; a 16:9 desktop plate is still needed (prompt A).
- Still owed once real plates land: contrast re-measure (4.5:1 on kicker/lede), plate opacity vs smoke,
  `DESIGN.md` §0 / §4 / §5 / §7 / §10, plate size ≤250 KB check.
- Note: `tasks/todo.md` was rewritten in the working tree by Codex (/gas plan, uncommitted); Step 3
  hero plan text lives in commit `4c65acc`. Not staged by Claude.
Dan, with a screenshot of the live hero: patina / garage vibe on the first screen, keep the gauge and
its readings where they are, show "we are a music plugin company", assets from Higgsfield, creative,
on brand.
- Plan: `tasks/todo.md` Step 3. Prompts for Dan to run: `tasks/hero-higgsfield-prompts.md`.
- Shape: a Higgsfield photo plate behind the hero (patina steel wall, one caged trouble light top-left
  as the light source, headphones on a hook, a shelf with a reel-to-reel + a VU rack unit), full-bleed
  inside `.hero-feat` (isolation: isolate, z:-2, opacity ~.85 so the smoke still reads), a warm rake +
  `--bg-0` scrim over it, `data-drift-y` 16. Gauge / kicker / headline / sweep / lede: not moved.
- Files that WILL change on build: `src/pages/index.astro` (hero only), `src/assets/hero/hero-wall*.jpg`
  (new), `DESIGN.md` (§0 / §4 / §5 / §7 / §10). Nothing else.
- Blocked on: Dan's go on the plan + the two plates from Higgsfield (A 16:9, B 9:16).
- TRIED AND DROPPED, do not rebuild: a RevEdit tuning bench for the plate and the text scrim
  (`hero.plate` manifest entry + `--plate-*` / `--lamp-*` / `--veil` / `--fade-*` / `--scrim-dx`
  knobs, commits `481560c` + `8e675ca`). Dan: "delete this bench, stick with what we already
  committed and live". Reverted by file in `8c6932a`; the hero is exactly `0be6bf5` again.
- Rule still in force: no push without Dan's word "push".
- VERIFIED CLEAN after the revert (Dan: "so you are sure we clean ?"). Eight checks: working tree
  clean; zero diff vs `0be6bf5` on `src/pages/index.astro` and `tools/revedit/revedit.manifest.json`;
  no `--plate-*` / `--lamp-*` / `--scrim-d*` / `hero.plate` string anywhere in `src/` or `tools/`;
  no plate `data-edit` hook (only the pre-existing `hero.text` + subs + `hero.gauge`); port 4430 dead;
  `origin/main` still `18afe01`; `dist/` carries no knob and still ships the plate.
- Clean confirmed IN PRODUCTION too, not only in the working tree: `curl https://revaudio.net/`
  ships exactly two `data-edit` hooks (`hero.text`, `hero.gauge`, both pre-existing) and neither
  live CSS bundle (`index.BzKgap4_.css`, `_slug_.CgmTf5oC.css`) contains `--plate-*`, `--lamp-*`
  or `--scrim-d*`. No bench knob reached the live site.
- One leftover found and cleared: the gitignored `revedit.overrides.json` still held an orphan
  `hero.plate` entry plus its slot in the desktop `order` list, created by the bench discovery pass.
  Removed. The pre-existing `hero.gauge` values (x -12, y 1, needle -135) were preserved. Local-only
  file, so it never reached a build or the live site - but a `git checkout` revert does NOT clean it,
  which is why it was missed on the first pass.

## 2026-09-06 — garage homepage pass: word wall + smoke (pushed as `18afe01`)
Owner: Claude Code. Repo `revaudio-website`, branch `main` (local, ahead of `origin/main`).
Dan's sequence today: "remove the background clock that gradients to red" (done, `c3fc068`, pushed);
"give us your best shot, garage vibe" (built as `/garage` preview, `7e4b3b6`, pushed too early);
"never push until i say to push clearly"; "revert to the website we had before you pushed"
(`3d2e17e` on main); then, pointing at the stencil-words section: "this is the only keeper all
others remove". So:
- **`src/pages/index.astro`** — imports `WordWall` and places `<WordWall />` between
  `<PluginShowcase />` and `<DAWStrip />`. That is the whole homepage change.
- **`src/components/WordWall.astro`** — LOUD / WARM / PUNCHY / GLUED / DEEP stencil words (brass
  outline, PUNCHY filled oxide) beside the RevLimiter window + one caption line, on the wood wall.
- **`src/components/GarageWall.astro`** — the product-page `.garage-wall` (wood tile, brass rails,
  top light, 38% scrim, `data-drift-y` parallax) as a reusable wrapper.
- **`DESIGN.md`** — website design spec per the constitution, trimmed to what ships.
- **Cut, not lost:** the three photo story rows (car plate, unit render, "30 days" door), the
  `/garage` route and `src/assets/garage/*.jpg` live on branch `garage-pass` (= `7e4b3b6`).
- **RULE (Dan, 2026-09-06): no `git push` on this repo until Dan writes "push".** Commit locally,
  report "committed locally, not pushed", wait. `tasks/lessons.md` has the entry.
- **Smoke (Dan, same day: "add the vibe of the smoke that we had before"):** the two haze plates of
  the old enginebg layer are back as their own thing. `src/lib/haze.ts` (drift + scroll-velocity
  blip + desktop pointer lean, reduced motion = static), `.haze` block in `global.css` (fixed,
  z:-1, paints `--bg-0`; body `background: none`; footer translucent again), markup + `initHaze()`
  in `BaseLayout.astro`, plates `public/bg/haze1.webp` + `haze2.webp`. NOT back: the tach arc that
  hue-shifted to red (the thing Dan asked to remove first), embers, waveform, heat curve.
- Checks: `npm run build` clean (19 pages, `/garage` gone), screenshots 1280 + 390 sent to Dan
  (word wall, then the smoke pass). Preview server left up on http://localhost:4321/.
- Pushed on Dan's word as `18afe01` (deploy green, live). Open question in DESIGN.md §10: which
  stencil word should be the filled one (currently PUNCHY).


## 2026-07-30 (later) — /gas left the shared product layout for a one-screen page
Dan, after seeing the walkthrough below: "ditch this revlimiter layout idea, make it a one pager
short like the size of a regular laptop." So GAS is off `[slug].astro` entirely.
- **`src/pages/gas.astro`** — new, owns the route. Portrait plate left, copy right, vertically
  centred, `min-height: calc(100svh - var(--nav-h))`. The plate is capped by HEIGHT
  (`min(66svh, 600px)`) not width — that cap is what keeps it one screen on a short laptop window.
  Content: name + FREE stamp, `plainHook`, `tagline`, three feature names, the download CTA, one
  mono spec line. Nothing else.
- **`src/pages/[slug].astro`** — `getStaticPaths` now filters out `'gas'`. Without that filter two
  files emit `/gas`. Also reverted the `hasStage` relaxation from earlier today: with GAS gone, no
  plugin has a partless feature (audited: revlimiter 13/13, radio-roulette 14/14), so the strict
  every-feature-mapped invariant is back and unused generality is gone.
- **`plugins.ts`** — GAS keeps its 6 features but loses `stage` + all `part` slugs (dead once the
  walkthrough went). Feature ORDER is now editorial: gas.astro prints the first three names as its
  only feature copy, so DRIVE macro / three voices / 8x oversampling lead. There is no second copy
  of that text on the page.
- **The CTA speaks TrialGateModal's trigger contract directly** rather than reusing `BuyButton` —
  BuyButton's bordered card (price block + 3-line `includes` list) is taller than the whole layout.
  Non-gated branch kept, so dropping `trialGateActive` restores the direct download here too.
  **Verified by clicking it:** modal opens with the free-plugin copy ("GAS is free — grab it",
  "Free forever. Full version, no trial clock"), email field present, `data-plugin-slug=gas` and
  the register URL both correct. The `#dl=`/`#p=` verify-email bounce-back still lands here because
  TrialGateModal lives in BaseLayout. **The download funnel is intact — do not "simplify" the CTA
  into a plain `<a href={downloadUrl}>`, that skips the email gate.**
- Measured: **5293px → 856px of content**, 5.3 screens → 1 screen. Everything above the fold at
  1440x900, 1366x768 and 1280x720. Mobile 390x844 also fits, but the plate had to come down to
  `32svh`: at 44svh the CTA landed under the fixed a11y/cart FABs and the spec line fell below the
  fold. `docScreens` still reads ~1.4 because the site Footer sits below the one screen — the page
  itself is one screen. Squeezing the footer in too would mean a ~480px plate; Dan's call.
- Zero console errors. RevLimiter and Radio Roulette both still render `data-walkthrough` (the
  route filter and the gate revert are no-ops for them).
- **Superseded, not deleted:** the part-highlighter work from earlier today is in `1724a27` +
  `daf25ba` with the 5 measured rects, if a future page ever wants them.

## 2026-07-30 — /gas moved from crossfade to the real part-highlighter stage (SUPERSEDED, see above)
GAS was the thinnest product page: one hero, no `stage`, so "What's inside" just pinned a single
shot. It now runs the same highlighter RevLimiter does.
- `src/data/plugins.ts` — GAS gets a `stage` with 5 part rects + `part` slugs on its features, and
  a 6th feature (**Parallel MIX blend**) for the top-left mini knob, which is a real control the
  page never mentioned. Also fixed a wrong claim: the old oversampling desc said "oversampled per
  voice", but `GAS/plugin/Source/GasEngine.h` explicitly uses ONE oversampler at one factor for
  all voices (HQ 8x / Eco 4x) so PDC never changes on a voice switch. Copy now says that.
- `src/pages/[slug].astro` — `hasStage` no longer demands that EVERY feature carry a `part`. It
  needs one resolvable part, and tolerates features with none. GAS's oversampling bullet is the
  Quality parameter, host-side only, with nothing on the panel to box; that step shows the plate
  undimmed. `walkthrough.ts` already did this for a missing `data-part` — only the gate was strict.
  A `part` that IS set but unresolvable still kills the stage (a typo should fail loudly).
- `src/assets/plugins/gas-hero.png` — replaced 802x1192 with a 1600x2380 headless render of the
  real WebView UI (`GAS/plugin/Source/ui/public/index.html`, served over http, Chrome
  `--window-size=1600,2380`; the UI's `applyZoom` scales its 400x595 canvas by innerWidth/400, and
  `inJuce` is false so it renders standalone). Pixel-for-pixel the same panel as before, just 2x
  the master. The stage asks for a 1200px-wide derivative, which was a 1.5x UPSCALE off the old
  source. Repeat the render the same way if the plugin UI changes.
- **Rect recipe for the next plugin:** compute from the UI's own CSS (element left/top/size, then
  fold in inline `translate`/`scale` and `transform-origin`), then verify by drawing the boxes onto
  the actual hero PNG before trusting them. Two of five were visibly off from CSS math alone,
  because `object-fit: contain` art and drop-shadows inset the visible control inside its box.
- Verified in a real browser (Playwright, built output on `astro preview`): stage mode active, all
  6 steps activate, live-measured box rects match plugins.ts exactly (26.8/27.5/46.8/30 etc.), the
  no-part step goes `visibility: hidden` + opacity 0, mobile ≤900px gives 6 carousel cards +
  "06 / 06" counter, zero console errors, RevLimiter still in stage mode (gate change is a no-op
  for it), /store card serves a 480x714 derivative of the new hero.
- **Still missing for true RevLimiter parity, both blocked on content, not code:** `audioDemos`
  (RevLimiter has 3; nothing exists for GAS, and no demos means no "Hear it" AND no garage wall,
  since `hasWall` = demos || trialUrl and GAS is free with no trialUrl) and `tutorialVideo`
  (RevLimiter has one on YouTube). `galleryImages` is NOT a gap — RevLimiter's is empty too.
- **Dead data spotted, not touched:** `StagePart.thumb` is populated for all 10 RevLimiter parts
  (`revlimiter-part-*.png`, ~10 files in `src/assets/plugins/`) but nothing in the templates or
  `walkthrough.ts` reads it. Either the mobile step-preview was dropped or never landed. Left
  alone deliberately — GAS therefore got no part thumbs. Worth a decision: wire it or delete them.

## 2026-07-26 — "What's inside" active card now aligns with the pinned shot (60e3123, live)
Dan reported the walkthrough section reading misaligned. Cause: `.walk-stage` pins high
(`top: sale + nav + 1.5rem` = 68px at 1280x665) but the per-step ScrollTriggers activated on a
hardcoded `top 55%` line at mid-viewport, so from step 2 on every card lit up 118-156px BELOW
the shot it described.
- `src/lib/walkthrough.ts` only — no CSS/markup change. The activation line is now the pinned
  stage's own centre, measured live (`sticky top + .stage-frame offsetHeight / 2`), via
  FUNCTION-BASED `start`/`end` so every `ScrollTrigger.refresh()` re-reads it. Do not re-hardcode
  a percentage here — it has to follow `--nav-h`, the sale banner and the shot's max-height cap.
- Tail runway: the higher line meant the LAST card reached it exactly as the stage unpinned, so
  `.walk-copy` gets a small JS-set `padding-bottom` (`max(0,(frameH-lastCardH)/2)` — 21px at
  1280x665, 0 on tall viewports, 144px on /gas). **Counterintuitive: bigger is worse.** Once the
  stage unpins, card and shot scroll together and hold their offset, so a large spacer only keeps
  the shot still while the card slides past (tested: 24px → last card exits at -2px; 128px → -105px).
  Set from JS + desktop-only on purpose — no-JS and reduced-motion get no highlighting, so a CSS
  spacer would be dead space to them.
- The lazy-shot `load` → `ScrollTrigger.refresh()` moved ABOVE the `if (!isStageMode || !parts) return`
  early return: the crossfade plugins' line depends on the same frame height and never got it before.
- Verified: card-to-shot centre delta went +118..+156px → -3..+14px, all 13 steps activate at their
  own line, at 1280x665 / 1512x950 / 1920x1080 / 1024x600 / 920x700, and on live revaudio.net.
  Drift / The AC / GAS / Radio Roulette (crossfade path) within ±4px after step 0. Step 0 shows a
  bigger delta on tall-shot plugins ((frameH-cardH)/2) — that is the pre-existing in-flow top-aligned
  opening, NOT a regression; it measured the same before the change.
- Residual ±12px wobble is the intentional scrubbed drift tween on `.stage-frame`. Leave it.
- Harness kept out of the repo (scratchpad): playwright scripts that park at each step's alignment
  midpoint and report delta + pinned. Rebuild from this note if the section is touched again.

## 2026-07-24 (later) — RESOLVED: CSP fixed via dashboard; trial funnel human-verified end-to-end
The Transform Rule was updated in the Cloudflare dashboard (Claude drove Dan's Chrome; Dan
approved): `connect-src` += license worker + www.google-analytics.com + googleads.g.doubleclick.net
+ www.googleadservices.com; `script-src` += www.googletagmanager.com. Verified: edge serves the
new header, live submit on /revlimiter#trial stamps PLATES ISSUED, verification email delivered,
**Dan clicked the verify link twice — portal unlocks, funnel works end-to-end.**
Remaining (optional "round 2", Dan aware): Google Ads conversion pings still blocked — needs
`https://www.google.com https://ad.doubleclick.net` in connect-src and
`https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net` in script-src. Until then gtag loads + fires but the
conversion never reaches Google. Meta's *.on.aws / *.run.app beacons also blocked (cosmetic).
Memory: revaudio-shared `reference_revaudio_edge_csp_transform_rule.md` (the recurring trap).

## 2026-07-24 — BLOCKER (resolved above): edge CSP blocks the on-page trial capture (and the Google Ads tag)
TEMP PLATES (#trial on product pages, `5c14c14` + `ba183a3`) POSTs the license worker's
`/download/register` cross-origin. Worker-side CORS is deployed & verified (DLREG_CORS,
version 64e6b84b), BUT the edge Cloudflare CSP (Rules → Transform Rules → Modify Response
Header, "Security Headers" — same rule as the 2026-07-19 Formspree fix) blocks the browser
fetch first: `connect-src` lacks the worker origin. Live behavior today: every submit shows
the graceful fallback ("open the download page instead") — nothing broken, but the plate
never stamps. Console also shows `script-src` blocking `googletagmanager.com/gtag/js`, so
the AW-18334323184 Ads conversion tag has never loaded on this page.
**Fix (dashboard, zone write needed — wrangler OAuth here is zone:read only):**
- `connect-src` add: `https://revlimiter-license.revaudio.workers.dev https://www.google-analytics.com https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net https://www.googleadservices.com`
- `script-src` add: `https://www.googletagmanager.com`
Then cache-bust re-test a real submit on https://revaudio.net/revlimiter#trial (expect
screws + PLATES ISSUED stamp, verification email via Resend).

## 2026-07-20 (evening) — Hero: hanging STORE sign SHIPPED & LIVE (4e281b8 + 78196fc)
- Gauge removed from hero. Replaced by a hanging wooden STORE sign off the LEFT edge:
  Higgsfield nano_banana_pro 2k true-alpha asset (bg-removed, green-despilled), sliced into
  `src/assets/hero/sign-beam.png` (static) + `sign-hanger.png` (swings: sway/click-kick/hover,
  links /store). Slice geometry + pivot documented in index.astro comments. Kick must stay ≤6°
  (seam overlap limit). Desktop/tablet only — hidden ≤860px per Dan. Hero↔showcase divider
  removed (scoped; global .hero border untouched elsewhere). Live bundle verified on revaudio.net.
- Local mockup bench `/signlab` (git-excluded) holds the approved CSS mockup lineage.
- NOTE: this session pushed around ANOTHER session's uncommitted enginebg WIP in this same
  worktree (BaseLayout/global.css/src/lib/enginebg.ts/public/bg/*) — those files untouched.


## 2026-07-20 — Plugin carousel "showroom polish" (pushed, live)
Six upgrades to `PluginShowcase.astro` only (spec + plan in `docs/superpowers/`):
- Peeks: blur killed → `saturate(0.55) brightness(0.7)`, legible side cards; hover brightens.
- Brass-trimmed frame: border-box gradient edge + CSS texture + `::before` glow — NO new DOM/assets; bench coords untouched, `/_cardbench` parity holds.
- Switch: 0.4s overshoot spring (`cubic-bezier(0.34,1.3,0.35,1)`).
- Arrows: brighter at rest + one-time glint via IntersectionObserver (skipped reduced-motion).
- Auto-advance: 6s, in-view only, hover pause, dies PERMANENTLY on first interaction, aria-live silent on auto (`go(target, announceChange)`).
- Height-aware `fit()`: measures `.site-nav`/`.sc-heading`/`.sc-dots` (site has NO `<header>` tag — don't `querySelector('header')`); also resets `scaler.style.height='auto'` before measuring — REQUIRED, removing it re-triggers a flex feedback loop that shrinks the stage across refits.
- Emblems (`.sc-emblem` + drift/ac/rev icon imports) removed as dead code.

## 2026-07-20 — Checkout/bundle review done (response to checkout-bundle-handoff.md)
Full verified review + ranked recommendation in **`tasks/checkout-bundle-review.md`**. TL;DR:
- **Now:** stay on Lemon Squeezy; implement GAS-free-bundle via the EXISTING `revlimiter-license`
  Worker (the brief's "no backend exists" premise was wrong) — cart passes
  `checkout[custom][gas_bundle]=1`, webhook grants GAS in the same branded key email. No second
  checkout, no new infra.
- **Later (trigger = second paid plugin live, or LS hard-sunset date):** migrate to **FastSpring**
  (only MoR with confirmed cart + bundles + built-in license fulfillment incl. remote-keygen URL
  + audio-plugin industry base: oeksound, Baby Audio, AudioThing).
- LS is in soft-sunset (Stripe acquisition → Stripe Managed Payments); LS will never ship a cart.
- Open questions for Gil listed in §5 of the review (starts with: why was Paddle dropped —
  evidence says LS just cleared KYC first, not a hard blocker).
Nothing implemented yet — review-only per the brief.

## 2026-07-19 — CSP connect-src fixed, forms POST successfully; email delivery still unconfirmed
Gil added `https://formspree.io` to the `connect-src` directive in the Cloudflare Transform Rule
("Security Headers", Rules → Transform Rules → Modify Response Header). Verified via curl
(cache-busted) that the edge now serves the updated CSP, then re-tested both forms end-to-end in
a real browser tab (had to cache-bust the tab's own load once — the first retry still hit a
pre-fix cached document even though the edge was already updated):
- **Affiliate form**: real UI submission → success message rendered, POST returned `ok:true`.
- **Newsletter form** (`f/maqzlgwa`): same fix covers it (same connect-src rule) — confirmed with
  a direct POST, `ok:true`.
- **BUT: Gil reports no email received yet at info@revaudio.net.** `ok:true` from Formspree's API
  only means the submission was accepted, not that a notification email actually sent. Likely
  cause: Formspree requires a one-time "confirm this form" click (sent to the notification email)
  on a newly created form's first submission before ANY notifications deliver — same behavior
  noted for the newsletter form back on 2026-06-13 ("Formspree sends owner a one-time confirm
  email on the FIRST submission to activate the form"). **Next step: check info@revaudio.net inbox
  + spam for that confirmation email, click it, then re-test.**
- **Cleanup needed regardless:** several test submissions (names like "CSP Fix Verification...")
  landed in both Formspree forms' Submissions tabs during this diagnosis — clear those out so they
  aren't mistaken for real applicants/subscribers.
- New CSP connect-src for reference: `'self' https://api.paddle.com https://*.lemonsqueezy.com
  https://www.facebook.com https://formspree.io`.

## 2026-07-19 — Affiliate Program Formspree endpoint wired (e0f8160, live)
- `site.affiliateFormEndpoint` now points at the real form: `https://formspree.io/f/mykrwolg`
  ("RevAudio Affiliate Applications" form, created by Gil). No longer a placeholder — the form
  will actually submit.
- Also added (a34dbb4): H1 splits "Affiliate" / "Program" across two lines; an optional
  "Other platforms" textarea lets applicants list more than one channel (one per line) instead
  of being limited to a single URL + platform pick.
- Notification recipient confirmed set to info@revaudio.net in Formspree Settings (2026-07-19).
- **BLOCKER found 2026-07-19: real submissions fail with "Failed to fetch"/"Network hiccup" on the
  LIVE site.** Root cause is the edge Cloudflare CSP (Rules → Transform Rules → Modify Response
  Header) — its `connect-src` is `'self' https://api.paddle.com https://*.lemonsqueezy.com
  https://www.facebook.com` and does NOT include `https://formspree.io`, so the browser blocks the
  fetch() before it reaches Formspree at all. Confirmed via `curl -sI https://revaudio.net/affiliate/`
  and reproducing the fetch directly in-page (TypeError: Failed to fetch). Same class of bug as the
  earlier webfonts/YouTube-frame CSP gaps — dashboard-only fix, Wrangler token is zone:read so CLI
  can't touch Transform Rules. **Fix: add `https://formspree.io` to connect-src.**
  **This almost certainly also breaks the newsletter form** (same fetch-to-formspree.io pattern) —
  re-test both once the CSP is fixed.
- STILL TO DO once CSP is fixed: one real test submission on the live site to confirm the email
  actually lands in the info@revaudio.net inbox end-to-end.

## 2026-07-16 — Affiliate Program page (693e2f3, live)
- New `/affiliate` page (nav label "Affiliates" — full "Affiliate Program" kept as page title/H1;
  "Affiliate Program" alone was the widest nav item by 60px+, so shortened to avoid worsening the
  existing 700px-to-~1074px dead zone where the desktop nav has no burger fallback and can overflow —
  that gap pre-dates this change, not fixed here, just not made worse).
- Application form (name, email, channel URL, platform select, audience size, why) POSTs to
  `site.affiliateFormEndpoint` in `src/data/site.ts`.
- Approval flow is manual-review-only by design (matches how Waves/iZotope-style plugin affiliate
  programs work) — no auto-accept path was built.

## 2026-07-14 — RevLimiter free-trial stamp + Driver's Manual video (2c6e166, live)
- New `TrialStamp.astro`: "GET YOUR FREE 14 DAYS TRIAL" on the door's buy-patch asset (B3 night-plate take), L2 hover lamp, press-in → navigates to the license worker `/download`. Mounted in `[slug].astro` between title and door (`.trial-slot` top 25px / left 48.4%, user-placed).
- Position bench ON the real page: open `/revlimiter/#cranep=1&stampedit=1` → drag stamp / arrow-nudge, readout prints paste-ready CSS. Conditional Astro scripts ship VERBATIM — keep that block plain JS (no TS).
- New "Driver's Manual" section between Hear-it and System requirements — data-driven via `plugins.ts` `tutorialVideo` (+ `trialUrl`); youtube-nocookie embed.
- **BLOCKER: the edge Cloudflare CSP (Transform Rules → Modify Response Header) frame-src only allows lemonsqueezy → the video shows a grey broken frame on live. Fix in CF dashboard: add `https://www.youtube-nocookie.com` to frame-src. Wrangler token is zone:read — CLI can't do it.**
- Pre-existing, FYI Gil: `connect.facebook.net/fbevents.js` (Meta pixel) is also CSP-blocked by script-src.
- Design bench kept at `bench/trial-stamp-test.html`.

## 2026-06-18 — RevLimiter checkout LIVE on Lemon Squeezy
- Back on Lemon Squeezy (Paddle plan dropped); store now activated, RevLimiter live.
- `REVLIMITER_CHECKOUT_URL` in `src/data/plugins.ts` = LS LIVE variant `.../checkout/buy/78885904-8a19-4e23-9510-31b50775ada5` (commit e43bcbf). Single source of truth; Cart/BuyButton read it.
- **Bug fixed (875e8d4):** Cart.astro was persisting `checkoutUrl` in localStorage, so a cart that added RevLimiter before the URL swap kept launching the OLD test link → LS orange TEST banner on-site while the direct link was clean. Now Cart bakes a `slug->checkoutUrl` catalog map (`[data-checkout-map]` JSON) and resolves fresh at checkout; never trusts stored URL. URL changes now take effect for everyone on deploy.
- LS test vs live: same `revaudiopg` subdomain + (here) same variant URL — the TEST banner is store-activation-level, not a separate URL. Don't chase "live variant URLs".
- STILL TO VERIFY (user): real test purchase delivers download + license key; LS-generated key must match plugin LicenseManager format `REVL.<b64>.<sig>` or fulfillment breaks despite checkout working. See memory project_revlimiter_lemonsqueezy_migration.


## Shipped today (all live on revaudio.net)
- **Scroll-scrub background system**: fixed `.page-bg` layer behind everything, brass dashboard art
  (`public/bg/aurora-test.webp`, 2048x6144, 106KB) sweeps top-to-bottom with page scroll.
  Logic in `src/lib/pagebg.ts`, wired in BaseLayout. Art width 90vw, side-fade via `.page-bg::after`.
- **Fluid layout**: `--maxw: min(1240px, 98vw)` (was fixed 1200px), nav follows.
- **Hero tuning**: gauge column `min(38vw, 520px)`; redline/lede/cta offsets via
  `--redline-x/--lede-x/--cta-x` defaults (198/92/218px) in index.astro.
- **Plugin section**: heading centered above card, card 730px, status label removed from PluginCard
  ("Checkout reopening soon" no longer shows on cards; product-page pill untouched).
- **Sections**: DAW strip tightened (2.5rem pad, 1.25rem gap, 1.05rem chips); newsletter 6rem pad,
  150px button, **fully transparent** (sits on bg art); footer 1.25/1.75rem.
- **New pages/nav**: `/terms` T&C page (14 sections, industry standard); nav = Home/Store/About/Support/T&C.

## Benches (the big workflow win)
`public/bench/home-bench.html` — master bench, live on prod too. Every homepage section has
sliders (bg width, hero, page frame, plugin, DAW, testimonials, press, newsletter, footer up/down).
User tunes on THEIR screen, hits COPY VALUES FOR CLAUDE, pastes; Claude bakes values into source
and syncs bench defaults. Also: `layout-bench.html`, `hero-bench.html` (superseded by home-bench).
**Bench defaults must stay synced with shipped CSS** — RESET ALL = production state.

## Open threads
- `aurora-test.webp` is the FINAL art for now but still has the test name — rename when user locks art direction.
- Newsletter/Formspree + Paddle checkout still on placeholder tokens (site.ts / plugins.ts).
- Background asset pipeline: ChatGPT art -> Real-ESRGAN 4x (C:\RevAudio\shared\tools\realesrgan) -> sharp resize 2048w -> webp q84.
- User laptop renders at 1280x665 CSS (sometimes dpr 2) — Playwright-test at 1280x665 FIRST.

## Don't touch
- DSP/plugin repos unaffected. Partner's motion system (lib/motion, reveal, scrub, splittext, walkthrough) untouched except pagebg addition.

## 2026-07-22 — Mobile high-end rebuild on `feat/mobile-high-end` (NOT pushed)
Branch = full mobile-only rework (~30 commits), reviewed section-by-section with Dan. Desktop
verified pixel-identical throughout. Highlights: lazy demo audio + YouTube facade (product page
~10.5MB → ~1.5MB), hero BUY/TRY buttons, slim cookie sheet, 44px targets, anchor sub-nav,
showcase→coverflow on phones, DAW strip brass logo marks + CSS 3D floor, crane door 322→242px.
- Dan KILLED (components deleted): HotspotTour, RedlineScrub, DawBridge — don't resurrect.
- Content: AAX claims removed from ALL buyer-facing copy (specs/buy/install/support/store/about)
  — AAX is deferred, and Pro Tools dropped from tested DAWs. NOTE: daws.ts still has
  pro-tools tested:true → homepage strip shows a PRO TOOLS chip; Gil to decide.
- Gil's main commits (checkout wiring + GAS badge nudges) cherry-picked in; badge values ported
  to the new coverflow (top:27px right:12px rotate(10deg) scale(.945) + 1.05rem inside stage).
- Touched partner motion files (mobile-scoped, Dan-directed): lib/reveal.ts (force-reveal
  2.5s failsafe), lib/walkthrough.ts (carousel arrow wiring). Desktop paths unchanged.
- Merge to main = live deploy → waits for Dan's explicit OK after a real-iPhone pass.
