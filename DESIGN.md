# revaudio.net — Design Spec

Derived from `shared/wiki/pages/design-language.md` §6 (the constitution). Written 2026-09-06 for
the garage homepage pass. Product pages (`[slug].astro`) already follow it; this file writes down
what they do so the homepage and every future page stay in the same garage.

## 0. Metaphor

THE OBJECT: **the RevAudio garage**, the workshop the plugins are built in. Not a dashboard, not a
showroom: a dark two-bay garage at night, one tube light on, the bench lamp on, a car under cover.

ERA/VIBE: late-'60s muscle-car garage. Oiled walnut wall boards, brass fittings, oxide-red steel,
amber lamps, a little dust in the light.

MAPPING TABLE (every visible part of the site maps to something you could touch in that garage):

| garage object                      | site part                                   | what it does for the visitor             |
|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| the big tach on the wall           | hero gauge medallion (`/` hero)             | the brand in one glance; needle = scroll |
| the back wall (wood + brass rails) | `GarageWall.astro` / `.garage-wall`         | the surface a section hangs on           |
| the parts rack                     | plugin showcase coverflow (`#plugins`)      | what's for sale, price on the tag        |
| stencil sprayed on the wall        | the word wall (`WordWall.astro`, home)      | what the sound does, in five words       |
| the plugin window hung on the wall | RevLimiter UI beside the stencil            | proof: this is the thing                 |
| the truck door with the handle     | BuyButtonCrane (product pages)              | the ONE way in: pull the handle          |
| the "goes with every vehicle" sign | DAW strip                                   | compatibility                            |
| the pit-crew clipboard             | EmailCapture ("Join the pit crew")          | newsletter                               |
| the steel roller door, half up     | closing CTA                                 | leave with the trial                     |

Plain language instructs, the metaphor only orients (PRODUCT.md): every CTA says what it does in
words ("Start your 30-day free trial"); the garage never has to be decoded.

## 1. Theme & atmosphere

You are standing inside the garage after hours. The tube light over the bench is the only cold
light; everything else is the amber of a bench lamp and the red of a tail-light. Surfaces are real:
walnut boards you could pry off, brass rails with rotated screws. Nothing floats; nothing glows
without a lamp to explain it. Depth comes from real surfaces (the wood, the rails, the plugin
window hung on them), not from gradients painted on the page.

## 2. Palette

House tokens, reused verbatim from `src/styles/global.css` `:root`:

- darks: `--bg-0 #0b0a09` (bakelite, the page), `--bg-1 #14110f`, `--bg-2 #1d1916`, `--bg-3 #2a2420`
- inks: `--fg #efe9df` (parchment), `--fg-dim #8a8275`, `--fg-faint #827c74` (AA on bg-0/bg-1)
- brass: `--brass #c9a35c`, `--brass-bright #e8c878`, `--brass-dark #8c6f3a` (3-stop rule: dark, brass, bright)
- chrome: `--chrome #d8d4cc`, `--chrome-dark #76726a`
- oxide: `--oxide #8b3a1f`, `--oxide-deep #5a2410`, `--oxide-text #d4622a` (AA text oxide)
- race-red: `--redline #c8331f`. ONE hero element per page: the `.hh-redline` sweep on `/`, the
  RevLimiter wordmark on product pages. Never on a second element.
- `--emerald #2f6b4a` for "armed / live" pilot lights only.

Additive, page-local: none.

Forbidden: pure `#000` / `#fff` outside `html.hc`; yellow speculars on red; race-red on buttons;
neon or glow without a lamp; the retired tach arc that hue-shifted toward the redline with scroll depth
(out in `c3fc068`, stays out). The smoke it sat on came back on its own (`src/lib/haze.ts`, §5).

## 3. Typography

- Display: `--font-display` Bebas Neue (fallback Oswald, Arial Narrow). Headlines are stamped
  into the wall: `text-shadow: var(--engrave)` on the garage wall, `--engrave-fine` for small caps.
- Body: `--font-body` Inter. Readouts and specs: `--font-mono`, in object units (dB, ms, `$`, `VST3 · AU`).
- Painted copy erodes with wear: stencil words on the wall are outlined brass that fills on hover;
  the filled word is `--oxide-text`, never race-red (Law 5 + one-hero rule).
- Kickers (`.hh-tag`, `.sk-tag`, `.ww-tag`): mono, letter-spaced 0.3em, `--brass`.

## 4. Components

- Hero gauge medallion: face PNG (static, lit), needle (rotates; the light never rotates), hub (static).
  Needle: -135° min, -90° idle, +90° redline, +135° max; scroll revs it; pointer micro-deflects.
- Garage wall (`GarageWall.astro`): `wall-wood.png` tile 512px, brass rail `wall-rail.png` top +
  bottom (`--rail-h` 30px, 22px at 480px and below), rail cast shadow, `data-drift-y` 24px parallax
  on the wood, warm top light + 38% scrim. Same wall as the product pages' `.garage-wall`.
- Word wall (`WordWall.astro`): five stencil words in Bebas, `-webkit-text-stroke` brass, opacity
  .5 / .72 / 1 / .72 / .5 outward from the filled word; hover fills any word in ~120ms house curve.
  The RevLimiter window hangs beside it with the shadow stack and one caption line.
- Trial CTA / buy: flat brass-bright button at the page end on `/`; the crane door on product pages.
- Coverflow showcase, DAW strip, EmailCapture, SubscribeModal, TrialGateModal: unchanged house parts.
- Support chat (`SupportChat.astro`, `/support` only): chat-app thread grammar in house materials —
  visitor right in 3-stop brass, Support left on dark steel with avatar + curved tail on a group's
  last bubble, time stamp inside the bubble, bakelite wallpaper with a brushed diagonal. Answers use
  a fixed grammar (also the worker's reply contract): key words **bold `--oxide-text`**, no wash
  behind them (Dan, 2026-09-08 — highlight was tried and cut); one step per line with a stamped
  badge; paths on engraved mono plates with a copy rivet; `[mac]`/`[win]` blocks shown for the
  visitor's OS with a flip chip; `!` hazard-stripe callout (oxide) and `+` pilot-lamp callout
  (emerald). Key words lamp once as the bubble lands, then settle. Bench: `bench/support-answers-bench.html`.

## 5. Depth & lighting

One light source, upper-left (~35% 25%). On the wall: a warm top light `rgba(255,214,150,.07)` to 0
over the first 32% of height, plus a 38% `--bg-0` scrim so parchment ink passes AA on the wood.
Shadow stack (all raised parts): `0 1px 0 #000` contact + `0 8-24px 24-48px rgba(0,0,0,.5-.6)`.
Hover: lift 1px + shadow grows; press: return, 2px max travel.

The smoke: two screen-blended haze plates (`public/bg/haze1.webp`, `haze2.webp`) on a fixed layer
behind the page at 16% / 10% under a 40% `--bg-0` veil (25% on phones), so the dust in the lamp light
reads through the hero and the translucent footer; solid section panels cover it. Off in `html.hc`.

## 6. Motion

Canon = the crane door (`BuyButtonCrane.astro`): physics, feedback only, in the page. Curves
`--ease-settle cubic-bezier(.22,1,.36,1)` entries 600ms, `--ease-exit` 300ms, stagger 90ms; hover
strikes ~120ms `cubic-bezier(.2,.9,.25,1.25)`. Scroll: needle revs; wood drifts 24px; reveals via
`data-reveal` (top 80%) with a 2.5s force-reveal. The smoke drifts on a slow sine (40/25px and
55/30px orbits), kicks up to 3.5x on a fast scroll and settles, leans up to 14px with the pointer
(desktop only). Reduced motion: everything visible at rest, no parallax, no needle rev, smoke static.

## 7. Hero + glanceability

THE hero is the gauge medallion with "Engineered, Then Tuned." over it. One glance: brass tach,
red sweep under the headline, "Boutique plugins" above. Everything below is the walk through the
garage: rack, stencil wall, the sign, the clipboard, the door. No second hero, no metric grid, no
card grid.

## 8. Layout

```
+------------------------------------------------------+
| HERO  gauge medallion + 2-line headline               |  ~100svh, vignette
+------------------------------------------------------+
| OUR PLUGINS  coverflow rack (#plugins)                |  unchanged
+------------------------------------------------------+
| WORD WALL  LOUD / WARM / PUNCHY / GLUED / DEEP        |  wood wall + rails; RevLimiter UI right
+------------------------------------------------------+
| GOES WITH EVERY VEHICLE  DAW strip                    |  unchanged
| JOIN THE PIT CREW  EmailCapture                       |  unchanged
| HEAR IT ON YOUR OWN MIX  trial CTA                    |  unchanged
+------------------------------------------------------+
```

Base: `--maxw min(1440px, 95vw)`; the word wall collapses to one column at 860px and below,
words first, window under them.

## 9. Do's & don'ts

- DO keep every claim checkable against the plugin source. Stencil words describe the intent of
  the tools, in plain adjectives; the caption line comes from PRODUCT.md / CLAUDE.md.
- DON'T add a second race-red element, a countdown, a star rating, or a press logo (data files are
  empty by design until real ones exist).
- DON'T absolute-position decorative props to pixel coordinates; wall and rails are flow +
  percentages so every viewport works.
- Astro scoped styles: anything injected at runtime or living in another component needs `:global()`.

## 10. History + open questions (for Dan)

- 2026-09-06 garage pass: three photo story rows (car plate, hardware-unit concept render, the
  truck door painted "30 days") were built, reviewed and cut by Dan; only the word wall stays.
  The cut work lives on branch `garage-pass` (commit `7e4b3b6`) if any of it is wanted back.
- 2026-09-06 Dan: "add the vibe of the smoke that we had before": the haze plates from the old
  enginebg layer are back as `src/lib/haze.ts`; the red-shifting arc, embers and waveform are not.
- Stencil words: LOUD / WARM / PUNCHY / GLUED / DEEP. Which one should be the filled (oxide) word?
