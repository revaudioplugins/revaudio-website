/**
 * Plugin catalog — single source of truth for store + marketing pages.
 *
 * Lifecycle:
 *   status: 'in-development' → no Buy CTA, only waitlist
 *   status: 'beta'           → Buy CTA shows but no checkoutUrl until product live
 *   status: 'live'           → Buy CTA active, set checkoutUrl to the Lemon Squeezy buy link
 *
 * ARRAY ORDER IS THE STORE ORDER: /store renders this list as-is, so shipping
 * plugins lead and in-development ones trail. Nothing else depends on order
 * (Header/Cart/TrialGateModal look plugins up by slug).
 *
 * Prices are intent — flip when commerce launches.
 * Checkout: engine-switched in src/data/site.ts (checkoutEngine). 2026-08-03:
 * 'ls' — Lemon Squeezy re-activated as the interim engine (checkoutUrl) while
 * FastSpring onboarding finishes (fastspringPath, ready to flip to). The
 * site-wide trial gate is LIFTED for the paid plugins; GAS keeps
 * `trialGateActive` on purpose — its email-gate IS the free download's
 * delivery mechanism, not a checkout pause.

    // 2026-07-30 and its one-screen page has no part-highlighter to feed. The
    // measured rects are in git if that page ever wants them (1724a27, daf25ba).

      { name: 'Parallel MIX blend', desc: 'The mini knob blends the driven signal against a latency-matched dry path, so you can park GAS on a bus and dial the grit in behind the clean. Double-click for fully wet.' },
